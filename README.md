# mBlock
The mBlock is modified based on the [source code](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-flash) of Scratch 2.0 offline version, mBlock plug in for the online version of Scratch is under devoloping. With mBlock, those who are familiar with Scratch can easily interact with electronic modules in Arduino eco-system.

mBlock add some hardware-related blocks in the original Scratch, with these blocks, users can read sensors, control motors and even a whole robot.

Besides blocks for the basic microcontroller functionalities, analog and digital writes and reads, PWM outputs. There are also blocks for each specific electronic modules, such as ultrasonic sensor, temperature sensor, light sensor, DC motor driver, stepper driver, etc. With these blocks, itâ€™s simple to interact with many kinds of electronic modules.
